# Chess Engine

This is a simple chess engine implemented in Rust using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for decision-making.

## Features

- **Minimax Algorithm**: The engine uses the minimax algorithm to search through the game tree and determine the best move.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Alpha-beta pruning is applied to improve the efficiency of the minimax algorithm by eliminating unnecessary branches.
