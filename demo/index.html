        <h1>Chessengine</h1>
        <p>The minimax algorithm is a fundamental concept in artificial intelligence, particularly in games like chess. It works by recursively evaluating the possible moves of both players up to a certain depth in the game tree. At each level of the tree, the algorithm alternates between maximizing and minimizing the potential outcome, assuming the opponent will also choose the best move possible.</p>
        <p>In the context of a chessbot implemented in Rust, the algorithm works by exploring the possible moves from the current board position, evaluating each one using a evaluation function that assesses the relative strength of the resulting board positions. The minimax algorithm allows the chessbot to make informed decisions about which move to make, considering both immediate gains and future consequences several (in this case 2) moves ahead.</p>
